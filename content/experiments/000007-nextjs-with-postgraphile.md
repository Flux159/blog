# Introducing next-postgraphile

## Motivation
TODO: Finish up

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an elegant web app starter platform that combines an opinionated webpack configuration with React and more recently a
lightweight [API layer](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

Using next.js with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) provides an elegant way to develop webapps applications quickly while utilizing the 
react ecosystem for prebuilt components. Due to how simple next.js makes development and deployment, it's become my go to development platform for 
javascript webapps.

## Graphql

[Graphql](https://graphql.org/) was developed as a query language for large API surfaces as an alternative to 
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Graphql allows web and mobile developers to define
what data they need from a backend declaratively with a single query while also providing valuable introspection capabilities
during development.

Graphql has allowed developers to rapidly update client frontends with new data as the API layer is updated. It has also enabled
the recent rise of rapid application development platforms like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and
[Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/).

## Rapid application development platforms

Rapid development platforms are not new - infact, you could argue that they predate the Web entirely with 
[Filemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker) coming out in 1985 on the Macintosh.

What RAD platforms do is allow developers to quickly iterate & release products to users while still finding product-market fit.
