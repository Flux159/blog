# Tigerbot
[Tigerbot](https://github.com/Flux159/Tigerbot/wiki) was a project in [college](https://www.cmu.edu/) for CMU's [Build18](http://www.build18.org/) event. It was a 2 wheeled robot made in 2011 that could be controlled via an iPhone. One PCB was custom developed, the low level microcontroller code was coded by Kevin Li, and the iPhone connected to the bot via a Beagleboard with USB Wifi.

# Newsatlas.io
[Newsatlas](http://newsatlas.io/) was a single page app that I used to learn AngularJS with - it is now defunct because Google removed the APIs that I was using to retrieve news data. The logic to map between a news article and the location was done client side based on how many times the articles description text contained a location. A filtered list of every city, country, and state was sent over to the client as a large dictionary to remove the need for a webserver.

# Slicer.io
Slicer was a reddit-like website where users could create spaces and post content (links, images, audio, videos). I wrote a React-like web framework with a browser + node router that could do serverside rendering for this website.

# ScriptFlow
[Scriptflow](https://scriptflow.io/) is a dataflow tool written in Node.js and React. I designed and wrote the graphical DAG engine, designed the website, wrote the docs, and deployed to AWS.
